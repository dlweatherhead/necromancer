# Necromancer

This is my entry for the Free Lives Game Jam for 2017, with the theme Collection.

The game is playable and downloadable on [itch.io](dlw.itch.io/necromancer).

Free Lives is a South African game developer, you can find out more [here](https://freelives.net/).

## Description

I wanted to capture the feeling of controlling a large flock or swarm of creatures, with inspiration coming from the Overlord games.
I think, despite other issues, I succeeded in capturing that feeling, however the game definitely lacks an overall goal.
The game could have also been improved with a better level or dungeon requiring more navigation, which would have helped guide the experience.
There are some bugs due to a poor implementation of the performance and navigation that should have had more time allocated.

## Requirements

Requires Unity version: 2017.1.0f3

## Notes

Note: In migrating this project there is a missing reference in the dungeon scene that would need to be resolved.
